/*

Create the objects that you feel would best model a jungle (using  OO design and coding practices or functional design and coding practices) based on the following requirements, using Javascript as the language of choice.


1. The jungle contains several species of animals; tigers, monkeys and snakes.

2. All animals can do three things, make a sound, eat food, and sleep.

3. Each species of animal knows how many others of its kind exist.

4. By default when an animalâ€™s energy level changes, it changes in the following ways:

  a. -3 for making a sound

b. +5 for eating food

c. +10 for sleeping


  6. Tigers get +5 energy for sleeping.

  7. Monkeys get +2 energy for eating and -4 energy for making a sound.

8. Some animals have the ability to play.

9. Only monkeys can play. When they do they say "Oooo Oooo Oooo" and get -8 energy. If a monkey doesn't have enough energy to play they say "Monkey is too tired".

10. The jungle contains several types of food; meat, fish, bugs and grain.
